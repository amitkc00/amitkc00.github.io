<h2>Amit Choudhary </h2>

<i> Over the years I have been interested/pursued many things and this is one of the many attempts to capture it in one place. I plan to talk my mind here. Expect slight discomfort. </i>
<p></p>
<i> I so much want to fill it with puns and satires but that could easily be a next life story as a comedian which was truly my life goal at some point but it didn't work out as planned. Will keep it civil for now. Maybe in future I can let the user select what Amit Choudhary they want to know about.. the sassy software Engineer or the classic Comedian. </i>

<h3>Mundane stuff for now</h3>
<ul> 
<li> <a href="professional_projects.html"> Professional Experience </a> </li>
<li> OSS Projects & Contributions : Not much to be honest. Infact 0. I have used open source libraries shamelessly all my life. I think if I can solve even few bugs, my life will be worth it. </li>
<li> Software Engineering Articles </li>
<li> Personal Random Thoughts </li>
</ul>
