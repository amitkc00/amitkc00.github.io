<h1> What have I been doing since 2007 </h1>
<i> This is not going to be a resume material but a summary of what I did, what mistakes I made and what I learnt from them. It will be about things I don't get to talk about in my resume or Linkedin. Each place I have been has shaped me of what I am today. A way to capture those learnings will be crucial for my self-guidance system in future.</i>
